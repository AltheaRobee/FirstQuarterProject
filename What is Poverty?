<h1> What is Poverty</h1>
<p> The term poverty refers to the state or condition in which people or communities lack the financial resources and other essentials for a minimum standard of living. As such, they cannot meet their basic human needs. Poverty is a socioeconomic condition that is the result of multiple factorsâ€”not just income. These factors include race, sexual identity, sexual orientation, and access to education, among others. </p>
<p> People and families who live in poverty may go without proper housing, clean water, healthy food, and medical attention. Each nation may have its own criteria for determining the poverty line and counting how many of its people live in poverty. </p>

<h3> Understanding Poverty </h3>
<p> Poverty refers to the lack of adequate financial resources such that individuals, households, and entire communities don't have the means to subsist or to acquire the basic necessities for a flourishing life. This absence of means can result in struggles to obtain food, clothing, shelter, and medicine. </p>
<p> Poverty is both an individual concern as well as a broader social problem. At the individual or household level, not being able to make ends meet can lead to a range of social, physical, and mental issues. At the societal level, high poverty rates can be a damper on economic growth and be associated with problems like crime, unemployment, urban decay, poor education, and poor public health. </p>
<p> Governments often put social welfare programs in place to help lift individuals, families, and communities out of poverty. Some countries have stronger welfare states (social safety nets) than others. </p>

<h3> Poverty and Children </h3> 
<p> The impact of poverty on children is substantial. Children who grow up in poverty typically suffer from severe and frequent health problems. Infants born into poverty have an increased chance of low birth weight, which can lead to physical and mental disabilities. </p>
<p> Children in poverty tend to miss more school due to sickness and endure more stress at home. Homelessness is particularly hard on children because they often have little to no access to healthcare and lack proper nutrition, which often results in frequent health issues. </p> 
<p> In certain developing countries, poverty-stricken infants are nine times more likely to die in their first month compared to babies born in high-income countries. Those who live may have hearing and vision problems. </p>
