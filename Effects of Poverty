<h1> Effects of Poverty</h1>
<h2> The Impact of Poverty in the World </h2>
<p> Home is the absolute foundation through which we can tackle the effects of poverty on society and its vicious cycle. Home is the key to living a life of dignity and opportunity, free from exclusion, fear or neglect. Let’s dig deeper into the main impact of poverty on health, children, education as well as communities – and how safe, decent homes can become the essential foundation for people to build happy, prosperous lives. </p>

<h3> Effects of Poverty on Health </h3>
<h4> Over 10,000 children die every day because they live in poor housing. </h4>
<p> Clean, warm homes provide protection from the elements and help improve a family’s health by preventing illness and diseases such as tuberculosis, diarrhoea, and malaria. </p>
<p> Without effective sanitation in their home, children are especially vulnerable to life-threatening diarrhoea and intestinal infections. And in houses where there’s insufficient ventilation, people are especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases. </p>
<p> Families who live in a properly constructed home are less likely to fall prey to such diseases and are better equipped to recover from any illnesses they may contract. It goes without saying that the mental health of individuals and families is greatly improved when physical health concerns are taken away. </p>

<h3> Effects of Poverty on Education and Schooling </h3> 
<p> Home gives children opportunity for the future by providing a stable foundation where they can study and do as well as they can at school. </p>
<p> Children are also able to develop into responsible adults as they experience security and see their own parents taking care of the home. For adults, home is key to maintaining employment and provides opportunities for income generation by the creation of home-based small businesses. </p>

<h3> Effects of Poverty on Children and Families </h3> 
<p> Home is indeed where the heart is and a stable, well constructed home is at the centre of family life. </p>
<p> When families have a home where they feel safe and secure they will draw together as a family unit to love and support one another. There is also an added sense of pride and dignity that comes with a decent home which translates to a hopefulness for the future well being and success of the family. </p>
